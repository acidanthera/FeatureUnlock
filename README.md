#### Additional Notes

* **NightShift** (macOS 10.12.4+)

* **AirPlay to Mac** (macOS 12.0+)

* **Continuity Camera** (macOS 13.0+)

* **Universal Control** (macOS 12.3+)
  * Requires minimum of Wifi N and Bluetooth 4.0 for wireless, wired is supported between iPad and Mac as an alternative
  * Note all parties check each other for compatibility, thus requiring FeatureUnlock on all models in the chain
    * Seen as `Ineligible Device Found Md MacBookPro11,4, SV 340.17.2` in Console under `UniversalControl: com.apple.universalcontrol`
    * Recommend using a different SMBIOS if possible, otherwise use `-force_uc_unlock` for machines that are not blacklisted but are connecting with a blacklisted model.
    * Due to the nature of requiring FeatureUnlock for both models, Apple Silicon and iPads will not work

* **Sidecar** (macOS 10.15.0+)
  * Requires minimum of Wifi N and Bluetooth 4.0 for wireless, wired is supported between iPad and Mac as an alternative
  * Requires a machine with an Intel iGPU active for reliable usage, most dGPU-only machines will experience difficulties. An H.265 capable iGPU is recommended for best streaming quality.
  * AMD dGPU-only machines may work if using an iMac19,x or iMac20,x SMBIOS with `gvaForceAMDKE` setting applied:

```sh
defaults write com.apple.AppleGVA gvaForceAMDKE -boolean yes
```

#### Boot arguments

- `-caroff` (or `-liluoff`) to disable
- `-cardbg` (or `-liludbgall`) to enable verbose logging (in DEBUG builds)
- `-carbeta` (or `-lilubetaall`) to enable on macOS newer than 26
- `-allow_sidecar_ipad` enables Sidecar support for unsupported iPads
- `-disable_sidecar_mac` disables Sidecar/AirPlay/Universal Control patches
- `-disable_nightshift` disables NightShift patches
- `-force_uni_control` forces Universal Control patching even when model doesn't require
